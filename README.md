# Introduction

Youtify is a web app built with React. Youtify connects your Spotify playlist with youtube. Tired of youtubing your songs or adjusting your youtube playlist each time you update your Spotify playlist? Youtify aims to solve that inconvenience.

## Installation

Use the Node Package Manager to install Youtify on your machine.
You will need a key from both Spotify and Youtube.
Download the files. Then run

```bash
npm install
(wait for installation of dependencies)
npm start
```
